### READ THIS BEFORE ADDING DEVICES TO AlexaPyHome ###

To add a new device type to the AlexaPyHome system, create a new .py file for
the device. Name it as you see fit, but try to keep it short. You must then add
the name of this .py file to __init__.py for the system to import it in
config.py

Use the skeleton provided in reference.py to show how to create a module that
integrates into AlexaPyHome seamlessly. Further documentation can be found on
the GitHub project (https://www.github.com/stereorocker/alexapyhome/)
